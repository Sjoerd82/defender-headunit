# MQ protocol

## Message format:

### Sending messages:

Format: `<path> <command> [return path]`

The [return path] is optional and can be used for filtering.
Examples:

`/source/subsource GET:0,4`
`/source/subsource GET:0,4 /flask/582`

### Sending data:

Data is send over the MQ with root path "/data"

Format: `/data/<path> <data>`

Examples:
`/data/source/subsource {data}`
`/data/flask/582 {data}`

In this example "flask" is the unique* application identifier.
The flask application can setup a subscription for "/data/flask/", the number can be an iterator to route back the received data to it's intended target.

# Data

## {data}:

Field | Value
--- | ---
`retval` | Return Code
`data` | Payload (can be anything, string, dict, etc.)

Example:
```
{
 "retval":200,
 "data": { payload* }
}
```

Payloads:

Structure | Value
--- | ---
`{int}` | [int](#int)
{bool} | [bool](#bool)
{source} | [source](#source)
{subsource} | [subsource](#subsource)
{state} | [state](#state)
{track} | [track](#track)
{volume} | [volume](#volume)
{level} | [level](#level)
{equalizer} | [equalizer](#equalizer)
{level} | [level](#level)
{device} | [device](#device)
{mode} | [mode](#mode)
{timer} | [timer](#timer)
{available} | [available](#available)

### {int}:
Integer value

Field | Value
--- | ---
`int` | integer value

### {bool}:

`order` | Used to order the sources by
`controls` | List of available controls (used?)
`template` | Boolean; If true, this source can have subsources.

The following fields are added by the Source Controller, and are thus also always available:

Field | Value
--- | ---
`available` | Boolean; If true, the source is available

Optional fields:

Field | Value
--- | ---
`depNetwork` | Is dependent on WiFi/Internet
`random` | List of available random modes

If the source has subsources, then these are included in the "subsources" key.

The following fields are added by the Source Controller, and are thus also always available:

Field | Value
--- | ---
`available` | Boolean; If true, the source is available

Example:
```
