Hardware add-ons required, these will be located on the HeadUnit "hat" or "shield"

 CORE functionality:
 - PhatDac

 SMALL stuff, which we'll include, because it's small:
 - header 1x[3 pin]: IR receiver header (2pin) + IR TSSOP chip (3pin)?
		     pins = VCC, GND, DATA
 - header 1x[5 pin]: 3.5mm jack (line-in) with mic and insert detection
                     1 pin = Gnd/Shield, 2 pins (L/R) to mixer, 1 pin for mic (IR/voice commands), 1 pin = insert detection, wire to GPIO
 - header 1x[3 pin]: volume, bass, treble via encoder (switch to switch between vol/bas/etc..)
		     2 pins = A,B encoder, 1 pin for push switch
 - header 3x[3 pin]: 2->1 Mixer + select via GPIO (Output: Amp. Inputs: PhatDac, Line)
		     1 pin = Gnd/Shield, 2 pins = L+R
 - header 1x[? pin]: Text display SPI?

 OPTIONALS A -- ADC
 - header 1x[4 pin] + 
 - chip ADC: 4Ch.ADC (2Ch for Remote, 2Ch for other things*)

 OPTIONALS B -- FM 
 - chip: FM+RDS receiver +
 - Antenna plug (header?? -- would be nice, +insertion detection?)

 OPTIONALS C1 -- POWER
 - Switching power supply; 3V/5V-32V

 OPTIONALS C2 -- BATTERY
 - LiPo battery circuit + battery plug

 OPTIONALS C3 -- SOFT POWER OFF
 - Cap/LiPo for soft-shutdown //and/or// button for soft-power off ==> Implement in one button

 OPTIONALS D -- CANbus
 - CAN bus transceiver (SPI?)
 - CAN bus header (2 pin)

 OPTIONALS E -- ENCODERS
 - 

 * Optionally: (Line-In detection??) Volume, Bass, Treble, Balance, but these are better implemented using rotary encoders.
   Bass and treble controls are better to be connected to the amplifier(??)
   Volume, Bass and Treble (and perhaps balance) are better implemented using incremental encoders, when it's (and it is) and they are also controlled by software.
   A volume knob controlled via ADC is absolute, now if the volume changes via a different input the ADC knob will be out of sync and volume level will jerk when the knob is used.
   Same goes for the Bass, Treble and Balance controls (where the latter is of least importance).

   Q. Is it better to implement the Bass and Treble knobs on the amp (if possible, it's ideal to connect Balance to the amp) or on the software?
      Connecting them to the amp will have the benefit that they can complement the software equalizer.e


Optional add-on hardware:
 - Flanged 3.5mm plug w/ insert detection
 - Flanged Antenna plug (insert/presence detection?)
 - Flanged IR receiver
 - Flanged Incremental Rotary Encoder for volume
 - Flanged Incremental Rotary Encoder 3x (bass, treble, balance)
 - Amp: Flanged Balance controller

Q. Pi has two SPI channels?			?
Q. Can the LVDS be used for the text display?	No
Q. Pi has a WiFi connector?			No, but solderable


GPIO:

 - ?x FM
 - 1x Line-In detection
 - ?x display		SPI/I2C

 - 1x Power Off
 - 1x Battery Low

PCB Form factor:

 - Pi sized PCB "shield", stack on top
	Pro:
	 + Space
	Con:
	 - High

 - Pi Zero sized PCB "hat", stack on top
	Pro:
	 + Small
	 + Shallow
	 + Will also stack on a regular Pi
	 + Connect "sideways" -> Shallow
	Con:
	 - Too small for all features?
	 - High (if stacked)

If we can fit everything on a "Hat", that would be ideal, but seems hard, also potentially problematic because of noise. esp. the power stuff.
Compromise:

 - Pi sized "shield", to be stacked on a Pi Zero. On the far side of the shield, we'll provide a connector for an addon that can than reside next to the Pi Zero.
	Pro:
	 + Space for all features
	 + Less noise? (we'll put the power stuff on the separate board next to the Pi)
	Con:
	 - High and wide

Nano: Smallest form-factor, for bookshelf speakers
	maybe build into one of those chinese bookshelve amps?

Enclosure form factor:

 - 1x DIN blank, shallow (for mounting behind existing console)
	Pro:
	 + Easy to source enclosure
	 + Spacious
	 + Standardized
	Con:
	 - Mostly useful in automotive applications (less usefull (too big?) on the bookshelve, suitcase)
	 - Hidden audio applications may not have this DIN-bay available

 - Combined with Amp.
	Pro:
	 + All-in-One box
	Con:
	 - Heat?
	 - Size

 - Custom plastic enclosure
   Flanged box, possibly IP67, to mount under car seat, or wherever.
   Width matches DIN size, so could also be mounted behind console.
	Pro:
	 + Custom
	Con:
	 - Price?
